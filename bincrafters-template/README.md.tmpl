$getVar('description', '')

The packages generated with this **conanfile** can be found on [Bintray](https://bintray.com/${user}/public-conan/${name}%3A${user}).

## For Users: Use this package

### Basic setup

    $ conan install ${name}/${version}@${user}/${channel}

### Project setup

If you handle multiple dependencies in your project is better to add a *conanfile.txt*

    [requires]
    ${name}/${version}@${user}/${channel}

    [generators]
    txt

Complete the installation of requirements for your project running:

    $ mkdir build && cd build && conan install ..

Note: It is recommended that you run conan install from a build directory and not the root of the project directory.  This is because conan generates *conanbuildinfo* files specific to a single build configuration which by default comes from an autodetected default profile located in ~/.conan/profiles/default .  If you pass different build configuration options to conan install, it will generate different *conanbuildinfo* files.  Thus, they should not be added to the root of the project, nor committed to git.

## For Packagers: Publish this Package

The example below shows the commands used to publish to ${user} conan repository. To publish to your own conan respository (for example, after forking this git repository), you will need to change the commands below accordingly.

## Build and package

The following command both runs all the steps of the conan file, and publishes the package to the local system cache.  This includes downloading dependencies from "build_requires" and "requires" , and then running the build() method.

    $ conan create ${user}/${channel}

## Add Remote

    $ conan remote add ${user} "https://api.bintray.com/conan/${user}/public-conan"

## Upload

    $ conan upload ${name}/${version}@${user}/${channel} --all -r ${user}
